          Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
          Web content is available on an ever expanding array of devices
          including ebook readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and
          electronic billboards. These devices have a variety of display
          screens. There are also a variety of mechanisms that allow these
          devices to use secondary display screens available in the local
          environment, attached by wired connections or remotely with wireless,
          peer-to-peer media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common attachment methods include video ports like VGA, DisplayPort
          or HDMI, or wirelessly through Miracast, WiDi, or AirPlay. Wireless
          screens may be available on a local area network or over the
          Internet, brokered by a cloud service. A device like a laptop could
          provide a screen for a smaller device like a phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many of these techniques the operating system hides how the
          screen is attached and provides ways for native applications to use
          the screens. Native applications on an operating system can easily
          use these additional screens without having to know how they are
          attached to the device. At this point, however, there is no way for a
          web page to take advantage of these available secondary displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Second Screen Presentation Working Group aims at defining simple
          APIs that allow web applications to show and control web content on
          one or more secondary displays.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this Working Group is to define an API that allows a web
          application to request display of web content on a connected display,
          with a means to communicate with and control the web content from the
          initiating page and other authorized pages.  Pages may become
          authorized to control the web content by virtue of sharing an origin
          with the originating page, explicit user permission, or other
          facilities provided by the user agent. The API will hide the details
          of the underlying connection technologies and use familiar, common web
          technologies for messaging between the authorized pages and the web
          content shown on the secondary display.  The web content may comprise
          HTML documents, web media types such as images, audio, video, or
          application-specific media, depending on the capabilities of the
          secondary display for rendering the media.  Application-specific media
          includes that whose type is known to the controlling page and the
          connected display, but not necessarily a generic HTML User Agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The API will provide a means to identify whether requesting display
          on a second screen is likely successful, i.e. whether at least one
          secondary screen is available for display.
        </p>
        <p>
          The API is agnostic with regard to the display connection used, and
          also works with display connections that support video only, for
          example, a TV connected to a laptop with an HDMI connection. In such
          a usage scenario, the web content displayed on a connected display
          must be rendered and converted to video before it is sent to a second
          screen. The User Agent may use whatever means the operating system
          provides to prepare and send the video to a second screen. Any
          interaction between the authorized web pages and the content
          displayed on a secondary screen would happen within the bounds of the
          initiating device since both the pages and the content are rendered
          on that same device, and only a video representation is sent to the
          second screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, if the second screen device understands some other
          means of transmitting content to a display and a means of two-way
          message passing, the web content can be rendered by the remote
          device. In this scenario, a URL to the content to be displayed is
          sent to the secondary display to be rendered there.  Because the
          content is rendered separately from the initiating user agent, pages
          hosted by other user agents may be authorized to control the
          remotely rendered content.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a requested piece of web content, how and by which device the
          content is rendered is an implementation detail. The user agent is
          responsible for determining which secondary displays are compatible
          with the content that is requested to be shown through the API.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specifications produced by this Working Group will include
          security and privacy considerations. Specifically, the user must
          always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be
          conveyed through the APIs, such as the visibility or access to
          secondary displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Members of the Working Group should review other working groups'
          deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
          Group's mission.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Success Criteria
        </h3>
        <p>
          To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected
          to have two independent implementations of each feature defined in
          the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          To advance to Proposed Recommendation, interoperability between the
          independent implementations should be demonstrated. Interoperable
          user agents hosting the same Presentation API web application should
          be able to render the same content with the same functionality on
          supported secondary displays that are compatible with the content to
          render.
        </p>
        <h3 id="out-of-scope">
          Out of Scope
        </h3>
        <p>
          The specifications defined by this Working Group abstract away the
          means of connecting and different connection technologies. For
          example, the following are out of scope:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower level APIs that expose features of different connection
          technologies
          </li>
          <li>How second screens are connected to the primary device (e.g.
          Video Port, HDMI, WiDi, Miracast, AirPlay)
          </li>
          <li>How the User Agent prepares and sends the screen contents to the
          second screen
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This Working Group will not define or mandate network protocols
          for sharing content between user agents and secondary displays.
          For example, the following are out of scope:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discovery of wireless secondary displays by the primary user
          agent</li>
          <li>Establishment of a messaging channel between the two parties,
          including message addressing, security and authentication</li>
          <li>Negotiation of a media streaming session between devices</li>
          <li>Network transport of media data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To facilitate interoperability among user agents and display devices
          and encourage adoption of the API, the group may informatively
          reference existing suites of protocols, either directly in the
          Presentation API deliverable or in a non-normative companion Note.
        </p>
        <p>
          Content mirroring, whereby a web application requests display of
          the content shown in its own browsing context (i.e., page) on a
          secondary display, is out of scope.
          If a web application requests display of itself (same URL) on a
          connected display, a new browsing context will be created with that
          URL and rendered on the connected display.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will not define or mandate any video or audio
          codecs.

          <dd>
            A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
            necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency,
            and implementability, and to promote interoperability between User
            Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
            suite, which should be completed before transition to Candidate
            Recommendation, and which must be completed with an implementation
            report before transition to Proposed Recommendation.
            Additional tests may be added to the test suite at
            any stage of the Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a
            implementation report is encouraged.

            To facilitate interoperability among user agents and display devices
            and encourage adoption of the API, the group may provide informative
            guidelines for implementors, either directly as informative notes

          The initial draft of the Presentation API was prepared by the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second Screen
          Presentation Community Group</a>. Upon approval of the Working Group,
          the Community Group will cease its work on the Presentation API
          specification. It is expected that the Community Group will recharter
          to work on other related deliverables where it is not clear enough how
          to proceed for it to be a work item for a Working Group. The
          Community Group is only one possible source for work under future WG
          Charters, but can serve to do initial exploration for some future
          work items.
        </p>

        <p>
          The specifications produced by this Working Group adhere to the Web's
          security model defined in the HTML specification published by the
          HTML Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common web technologies that this Working Group could refer to for
          messaging purpose include HTML5 Web Messaging and the Web Socket API
          defined by the Web Applications Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the scopes of the APIs are different, some of the use
          cases that the Presentation API aims to address, in particular
          projection of web content on second screens connected to the local
          area network, are also in scope of the Network Service Discovery API
          worked upon by the Device APIs Working Group. This Working Group will
          liaise with the Device APIs Working Group, in particular to ensure
          consistency of supported service discovery mechanisms when a user
          agent implements both APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group is not aware of any dependencies other
          Working Groups’ specifications have on this Working Group’s
          specifications.

            To be successful, the Second Screen Presentation Working Group is
            expected to have 10 or more active participants for its duration,
            and to have the participation of industry leaders in fields
            relevant to the specifications it produces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute one
            half-day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum
            requirement for other Participants. This Working Group will also
            allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for each
            specification.

            The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
            submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each
            participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under
