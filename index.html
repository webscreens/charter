          Goals
        </h2>
        <p>
          Web content is available on an ever expanding array of devices
          including ebook readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and
          electronic billboards. These devices have a variety of device display
          screens. There are also a variety of mechanisms that allow these
          devices to use display screens available in the local environment.
          Common methods include attaching through video ports like VGA, DisplayPort or HDMI, or
          wirelessly through Miracast, WiDi, or AirPlay. Screens can also be
          attached over a network. A device like a laptop could provide a
          screen for a smaller device like a phone. For many of these
          techniques the operating system hides how the screen is attached and
          provides ways for native applications to use the screens. Native
          applications on an operating system can easily use these additional
          screens without having to know how they are attached to the device.
          At this point, however, there is no way for a web page to take advantage of
          these available secondary displays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this Working Group is to define simple APIs that allow
          web content to use available secondary displays.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The scope of this Working Group is to define APIs to allow web
          applications to access the underlying OS capabilities to display web
          content on secondary screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specifications produced by this Working Group will include
          security and privacy considerations. Specifically, the user must
          always be in control of privacy-sensitive information that may be
          conveyed through the APIs, such as the visibility or access to second
          screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Members of the Working Group should review other working groups'
          deliverables that are identified as being relevant to the Working
          Group's mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group's deliverables are split in two phases, and to
          reflect that, the scope section is divided similarly for clarity.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Phase 1
        </h3>
        <p>
          An API to allow a web application to request display of an HTML page
          on a second screen, with a means to communicate with and control the
          second page from the initiating page. The API will hide the details
          of the underlying connection technologies and use familiar, common
          web technologies for messaging between the initiating page and the
          page being displayed on the second device.
        </p>
        <p>The API will provide a means to identify whether requesting display
            on a second screen is likely successful, i.e. whether at least
            one secondary screen is available for display.
        <p>
          The API is agnostic with regard to the display connection used, and
          also works with display connections that support video only, for
          example, a TV connected to a laptop with an HDMI connection. In such
          a usage scenario, the second page displayed on the second screen must
          be rendered and converted to video before it is sent to the second
          screen. The User Agent may use whatever means the operating system
          provides to prepare and send the video to the second screen. Any
          interaction between the initiating web page and the page displayed on
          the second screen would happen within the bounds of the initiating
          device since both the pages are rendered on that same device, and
          only a video representation is sent to the second screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, if the second screen device understands some other means
          of transmitting a page to a display and a means of two-way message
          passing, the second page can be rendered by the remote device. How
          and by which device the second page is rendered is an implementation
          detail. The User Agent provides access to any secondary displays it
          has access to, regardless of which device renders the second page.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Phase 2
        </h3>
        <p class="toadd">
          @TBD - the group should decide which of the <a href=
          "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webscreens/2014Mar/0025.html">
          following aspects discussed in the Community Group</a>, if any, are
          in scope for this Working Group:
        </p>
        <ol class="toadd">
          <li>Connection technology protocol level discovery
          </li>
          <li>Connection establishment and transport, including message
          addressing, security and authentication
          </li>
          <li>Application / media control protocol
          </li>
          <li>Media streaming
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The Phase 1 deliverable does not have a dependency on the Phase 2
          deliverables.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Success Criteria
        </h3>
        <p>
          To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected
          to have two independent implementations of each feature defined in
          the specification.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Out of Scope
        </h3>
        <p>
          The specifications defined by this Working Group abstract away the
          means of connecting and different connection technologies. For
          example, the following is out of scope:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower level APIs that expose features of different connection
          technologies
          </li>
          <li>How second screens are connected to the primary device (e.g.
          Video Port, HDMI, WiDi, Miracast, AirPlay)
          </li>
          <li>How the User Agent prepares and sends the screen contents to the
          second screen
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Two common modes of second screen usage in general are:
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
          <li>the second screen mirrors the first screen (e.g. display on the
          laptop is copied on a TV); and
          </li>
          <li>the second screen extends the first screen and acts as if the
          second screen is off one edge of the primary screen.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In case (b), the content is not the same and web content can run
          entirely on the second screen (e.g. a remote control on the first
          screen and a video being played on the second). This Working Group
          focuses on the case (b).
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will not define or mandate any video or audio
          codecs.

          <dd>
            A comprehensive test suite for all features of a specification is
            necessary to ensure the specification's robustness, consistency,
            and implementability, and to promote interoperability between User
            Agents. Therefore, each specification must have a companion test
            suite, which should be completed by the end of the Last Call phase,
            and must be completed, with an implementation report, before
            transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed
            Recommendation. Additional tests may be added to the test suite at
            any stage of the Recommendation track, and the maintenance of a
            implementation report is encouraged.

            The Working Group is strongly encouraging the participants to
            create and maintain a use cases and requirements document for each
            specification.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Other non-normative documents may be created for each specification,
          for example:

        <ul>
          <li>Primers

          its Presentation API specification and will cease its work on the
          deliverable. The Community Group may recharter to work on other

            As explained in the Process Document (<a href=
            "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
            consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent,
            after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should
            record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any
            objections, and move on.
